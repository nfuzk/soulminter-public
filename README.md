This repository contains the key frontend files (wallet connection, transaction logic, and UI) for transparency and community trust. It is NOT a full buildable project.

- The full source code is private.
- The files here allow you to review how wallet connections and transactions are handled.
- We never store private keys or sensitive user data.
