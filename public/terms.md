# SoulMinter Terms of Service

**Last Updated: November 22, 2025**

## 1. Introduction and Acceptance of Terms

Welcome to SoulMinter.io (the "Platform"), a web-based service that facilitates the creation and management of custom tokens on the Solana blockchain. These Terms of Service ("Terms") constitute a legally binding agreement between you ("User," "you," or "your") and SoulMinter ("we," "us," or "our"), governing your access to and use of the Platform and its services. By accessing, browsing, or using any part of the Platform, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by these Terms, our Privacy Policy, and our Disclaimer, all of which are incorporated herein by reference. If you do not agree to these Terms, you must not access or use the Platform.

**IMPORTANT NOTICE:** These Terms contain provisions that govern how disputes between you and SoulMinter are resolved, including a mandatory arbitration provision and a waiver of class action rights. Please read these Terms carefully before using the Platform.

## 2. Nature of the Service

SoulMinter provides a non-custodial, technical tool that enables users to interact with the Solana blockchain to create custom SPL (Solana Program Library) tokens and manage existing tokens. Our service is limited to providing the software interface and infrastructure to facilitate on-chain token creation and management based on parameters you provide. **This includes the ability to manage tokens created directly on SoulMinter as well as tokens created via other methods (e.g., Solana CLI or third-party platforms).** We do not:

- **Provide Financial, Investment, or Legal Advice:** SoulMinter is not a financial institution, investment advisor, broker, or legal counsel. Any information provided on the Platform, including descriptions of token functionalities or general market information, is for informational purposes only and does not constitute financial, investment, legal, or tax advice. You are solely responsible for conducting your own due diligence and consulting with qualified professionals before making any decisions related to crypto-assets or using our services.

- **Operate as a Crypto-Asset Exchange or Trading Platform:** SoulMinter does not facilitate the exchange of crypto-assets for fiat currency or other crypto-assets, nor does it operate a secondary market for trading tokens created on our Platform. We do not provide order matching, price discovery, or any other services typically associated with crypto-asset exchanges.

- **Act as a Custodian of Crypto-Assets:** SoulMinter does not take custody of your private keys, wallet, or any crypto-assets, including the tokens you create or manage using our Platform. You retain full and exclusive control over your wallet and all associated assets at all times. We do not have access to your funds or the ability to transfer them.

- **Guarantee Token Value or Performance:** We do not make any representations or warranties regarding the future value, liquidity, or performance of any tokens created or managed using our Platform. The value of crypto-assets is highly volatile and can result in significant losses.

- **Endorse or Validate Tokens:** The creation or management of a token on our Platform does not imply any endorsement, validation, or approval by SoulMinter of the token, its underlying project, or its compliance with any laws or regulations. You are solely responsible for the tokens you create or manage and any activities associated with them.

## 3. User Eligibility and Representations

By using the Platform, you represent and warrant that:

- You are at least 18 years of age and have the legal capacity to enter into these Terms.

- You are not located in, or a citizen or resident of, any jurisdiction where the use of our services is prohibited by law or where SoulMinter is prohibited from offering its services.

- You will comply with all applicable laws, regulations, and governmental policies in your jurisdiction regarding the use of crypto-assets and our services, including but not limited to anti-money laundering (AML), counter-terrorism financing (CTF), securities laws, and consumer protection laws.

- You will use the Platform only for lawful purposes and in accordance with these Terms.

- All information you provide to us is true, accurate, complete, and current.

## 4. User Responsibilities and Prohibited Conduct

### 4.1. General Responsibilities

As a User of SoulMinter, you are solely responsible for:

- **Wallet Security:** Maintaining the security and confidentiality of your Solana-compatible wallet, including your private keys and seed phrases. SoulMinter is not responsible for any loss or theft of your crypto-assets resulting from your failure to secure your wallet.

- **Accuracy of Information:** Ensuring the accuracy and completeness of all information you provide for token creation or management, including token name, symbol, decimals, supply, and metadata. You bear all risks associated with inaccurate or misleading information.

- **Irreversible Management Actions:** Understanding that certain management actions facilitated by the Platform—such as revoking Mint Authority or Freeze Authority—are **irreversible technical actions** on the Solana blockchain. Once an authority is revoked, it cannot be restored. SoulMinter is not responsible for any loss of utility, control, or value resulting from your execution of these irreversible actions.

- **Compliance of Tokens:** Ensuring that any tokens you create or manage using the Platform, and any subsequent activities related to those tokens (e.g., public offerings, sales, distribution, marketing), comply with all applicable laws and regulations in all relevant jurisdictions. This includes, but is not limited to, securities laws, consumer protection laws, and crypto-asset regulations. **SoulMinter expressly disclaims any responsibility for the legal or regulatory compliance of tokens created or managed by users on the Platform. You acknowledge and agree that SoulMinter has no obligation to monitor or verify the legality or compliance of any tokens created or managed by you.**

- **Tax Obligations:** Determining and paying any taxes applicable to your activities on the Platform, including token creation/management fees, affiliate commissions, and any gains derived from crypto-assets.

- **Due Diligence:** Conducting your own independent research and due diligence on the legal, regulatory, financial, and technical aspects of crypto-assets and the Solana blockchain before using our services.

### 4.2. Prohibited Conduct

You agree not to engage in, or attempt to engage in, any of the following prohibited activities:

- **Illegal Activities:** Using the Platform for any illegal purpose, including but not limited to money laundering, terrorist financing, fraud, market manipulation, or any activity that violates applicable laws or regulations.

- **Harmful Content:** Creating tokens or metadata that are unlawful, defamatory, obscene, pornographic, indecent, abusive, harassing, violent, hateful, inflammatory, or otherwise objectionable.

- **Intellectual Property Infringement:** Creating tokens or metadata that infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others, including copyrights, trademarks, or patents.

- **Misleading or Deceptive Practices:** Creating tokens with misleading names, symbols, or descriptions, or engaging in any deceptive practices intended to defraud or mislead other users or the public.

- **System Abuse:** Interfering with or disrupting the integrity or performance of the Platform or its underlying infrastructure, including introducing viruses, worms, or other malicious code.

- **Unauthorized Access:** Attempting to gain unauthorized access to any part of the Platform, other users' accounts, or the Solana blockchain.

- **Commercial Use without Authorization:** Using the Platform for any commercial purpose not expressly permitted by these Terms.

- **Resale of Services:** Reselling or sublicensing any part of the Platform's services without our prior written consent.

- **Data Scraping:** Using any automated system or software to extract data from the Platform for commercial purposes without our express written consent.

**SoulMinter reserves the right, but is not obligated, to monitor user activity and content on the Platform. However, given the technical and non-custodial nature of our service and our minimal data collection, we cannot actively prevent or be held liable for all instances of prohibited conduct or malicious use by users. You acknowledge that you use the Platform at your own risk and are solely responsible for your actions and the compliance of your tokens. SoulMinter shall not be liable for any damages or losses arising from your engagement in prohibited conduct or malicious use of the Platform.** If we determine, in our sole discretion, that you have engaged in any prohibited conduct, we may, without notice, suspend or terminate your access to the Platform and take any other action deemed appropriate, including reporting to relevant authorities.

## 5. Fees and Payments

SoulMinter charges fees for token creation and certain management services, which are clearly displayed on the Platform at the time of the transaction. By proceeding with a transaction, you agree to pay the specified fee. Please note:

- **Non-Refundable:** All fees paid for token creation or management are non-refundable once the transaction is successfully processed on the Solana blockchain.

- **Fee Changes:** We reserve the right to change our fees at any time. Any changes will be effective immediately upon posting on the Platform. It is your responsibility to review the current fees before initiating a transaction.

- **Network Costs:** The fee covers our service costs and network transaction fees (gas fees) associated with the Solana blockchain. You acknowledge that blockchain transaction fees are dynamic and outside of our control.

- **Affiliate Commission:** A portion of the fee may be allocated as an affiliate commission to a referring user, as detailed in our Affiliate Program terms. This is a marketing incentive and not a financial service provided by SoulMinter.
