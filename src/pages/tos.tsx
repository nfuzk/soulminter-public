These Terms of Service (&quot;Terms&quot;) constitute a legally binding agreement between you (&quot;User,&quot; &quot;you,&quot; or &quot;your&quot;) and SoulMinter (&quot;we,&quot; &quot;us,&quot; or &quot;our&quot;), governing your access to and use of the Platform and its services. By accessing, browsing, or using any part of the Platform, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by these Terms, our Privacy Policy, and our Disclaimer, all of which are incorporated herein by reference. If you do not agree to these Terms, you must not access or use the Platform.</p>
            <p><b>IMPORTANT NOTICE:</b> These Terms contain provisions that govern how disputes between you and SoulMinter are resolved, including a mandatory arbitration provision and a waiver of class action rights. Please read these Terms carefully before using the Platform.</p>

            <h2>2. Nature of the Service</h2>
            <p>SoulMinter provides a non-custodial, technical tool that enables users to interact with the Solana blockchain to create custom SPL (Solana Program Library) tokens. Our service is limited to providing the software interface and infrastructure to facilitate on-chain token creation based on parameters you provide. We do not:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><b>Provide Financial, Investment, or Legal Advice:</b> SoulMinter is not a financial institution, investment advisor, broker, or legal counsel. Any information provided on the Platform, including descriptions of token functionalities or general market information, is for informational purposes only and does not constitute financial, investment, legal, or tax advice. You are solely responsible for conducting your own due diligence and consulting with qualified professionals before making any decisions related to crypto-assets or using our services.</li>
              <li><b>Operate as a Crypto-Asset Exchange or Trading Platform:</b> SoulMinter does not facilitate the exchange of crypto-assets for fiat currency or other crypto-assets, nor does it operate a secondary market for trading tokens created on our Platform. We do not provide order matching, price discovery, or any other services typically associated with crypto-asset exchanges.</li>
              <li><b>Act as a Custodian of Crypto-Assets:</b> SoulMinter does not take custody of your private keys, wallet, or any crypto-assets, including the tokens you create using our Platform. You retain full and exclusive control over your wallet and all associated assets at all times. We do not have access to your funds or the ability to transfer them.</li>
              <li><b>Guarantee Token Value or Performance:</b> We do not make any representations or warranties regarding the future value, liquidity, or performance of any tokens created using our Platform. The value of crypto-assets is highly volatile and can result in significant losses.</li>
              <li><b>Endorse or Validate User-Created Tokens:</b> The creation of a token on our Platform does not imply any endorsement, validation, or approval by SoulMinter of the token, its underlying project, or its compliance with any laws or regulations. You are solely responsible for the tokens you create and any activities associated with them.</li>
            </ul>

              <li>You will comply with all applicable laws, regulations, and governmental policies in your jurisdiction regarding the use of crypto-assets and our services, including but not limited to anti-money laundering (AML), counter-terrorism financing (CTF), securities laws, and consumer protection laws.</li>
              <li>You will use the Platform only for lawful purposes and in accordance with these Terms.</li>
              <li>All information you provide to us is true, accurate, complete, and current.</li>

            </ul>
            <p><b>SoulMinter reserves the right, but is not obligated, to monitor user activity and content on the Platform. However, given the technical and non-custodial nature of our service and our minimal data collection, we cannot actively prevent or be held liable for all instances of prohibited conduct or malicious use by users. You acknowledge that you use the Platform at your own risk and are solely responsible for your actions and the compliance of your created tokens. SoulMinter shall not be liable for any damages or losses arising from your engagement in prohibited conduct or malicious use of the Platform.</b> If we determine, in our sole discretion, that you have engaged in any prohibited conduct, we may, without notice, suspend or terminate your access to the Platform and take any other action deemed appropriate, including reporting to relevant authorities.</p>

            <h2>5. Fees and Payments</h2>
            <p>SoulMinter charges a fee for the token creation service, which is clearly displayed on the Platform at the time of creation. By proceeding with token creation, you agree to pay the specified fee. Please note:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><b>Non-Refundable:</b> All fees paid for token creation are non-refundable once the transaction is successfully processed on the Solana blockchain.</li>
              <li><b>Fee Changes:</b> We reserve the right to change our fees at any time. Any changes will be effective immediately upon posting on the Platform. It is your responsibility to review the current fees before initiating a token creation.</li>
              <li><b>Network Costs:</b> The fee covers our service costs and network transaction fees (gas fees) associated with the Solana blockchain. You acknowledge that blockchain transaction fees are dynamic and outside of our control.</li>
              <li><b>Affiliate Commission:</b> A portion of the token creation fee may be allocated as an affiliate commission to a referring user, as detailed in our Affiliate Program terms. This is a marketing incentive and not a financial service provided by SoulMinter.</li>

          </section>
          <section>
            <h2>6. Intellectual Property</h2>

THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY APPLIES WHETHER THE ALLEGED LIABILITY IS BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT, NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY, OR ANY OTHER BASIS, EVEN IF SOULMINTER HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.</p>

            <h3>12.5. Force Majeure</h3>
